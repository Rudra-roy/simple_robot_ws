# Path Visualization Update - Hybrid Navigation Planner

## Overview
Updated the hybrid navigation planner to visualize both **global** (straight-line) and **local** (A*) paths on the `/planned_path` topic, depending on the current navigation mode.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `publish_path()` Function

**Location**: Line ~1720

**Changes**:
- Added `path_type` parameter to distinguish between "global" and "local" paths
- Global paths (straight-line) are drawn at z=0.1m (slightly elevated)
- Local paths (A*) are drawn at z=0.0m (ground level)
- Added orientation calculation along the path for better visualization
- Added debug logging to indicate which type of path is published

**Benefits**:
- Visual distinction between path types in RViz (different heights)
- Path poses now have proper orientations (arrows point along path)
- Clearer understanding of robot's navigation strategy

### 2. New `publish_global_path_to_goal()` Function

**Location**: Line ~1690

**Purpose**: Create and publish straight-line path from robot to goal during global planning mode

**Features**:
- Interpolates waypoints every 0.5m along the straight line
- Ensures minimum 2 waypoints (start and goal)
- Published as "global" type path

**When Called**: Every control loop iteration during `GLOBAL_PLANNER` state

### 3. Updated `execute_global_planner()` State

**Location**: Line ~220

**Changes**:
- Added call to `publish_global_path_to_goal()` before executing velocity commands
- Path is updated in real-time as robot moves toward goal

**Behavior**: Shows intended straight-line path in RViz when no obstacles block the way

### 4. Updated `execute_local_avoidance()` State

**Location**: Line ~645

**Changes**:
- Added continuous publishing of current A* path
- Path is republished every control loop iteration

**Behavior**: Shows A* planned path in RViz when navigating around obstacles

### 5. Updated A* Path Planning Function

**Location**: Line ~1310

**Changes**:
- Updated `publish_path()` call to include `path_type="local"`
- Clearly marks A* paths as local navigation paths

## Path Type Indicators

### Global Path (Straight-Line Navigation)
```
Characteristics:
- Type: "global"
- Color in RViz: Depends on RViz settings (typically green/blue)
- Height: z = 0.1m (slightly elevated)
- Published during: GLOBAL_PLANNER state
- Purpose: Direct path to goal when clear
```

### Local Path (A* Obstacle Avoidance)
```
Characteristics:
- Type: "local"
- Color in RViz: Depends on RViz settings (typically red/yellow)
- Height: z = 0.0m (ground level)
- Published during: LOCAL_AVOIDANCE state
- Purpose: Navigate around obstacles using A* planner
```

## RViz Visualization Setup

### Add Path Display

1. **Add Path Display**:
   - Click "Add" button in RViz
   - Select "Path" from display types
   - Set Topic: `/planned_path`

2. **Configure Display**:
   ```
   Topic: /planned_path
   Color: By default or custom
   Alpha: 1.0
   Line Width: 0.05
   Pose Style: Arrows (to see orientation)
   Pose Color: Inherit from path
   ```

3. **Visual Distinction**:
   - Global paths appear slightly above ground (z=0.1)
   - Local paths appear at ground level (z=0.0)
   - Both show arrow orientations along the path

## State Machine Behavior

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    NAVIGATION STATES                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

IDLE State
├─ No path published
└─ Waiting for goal

GLOBAL_PLANNER State
├─ Publishes: Global straight-line path
├─ Updates: Every control loop (10 Hz)
├─ Visualization: Green line from robot → goal
└─ Switches to LOCAL_AVOIDANCE if obstacle detected

SURVEYING State
├─ No path published (rotating to scan)
└─ After survey: Plans A* path and switches to LOCAL_AVOIDANCE

LOCAL_AVOIDANCE State
├─ Publishes: Local A* path
├─ Updates: Every control loop (10 Hz)
├─ Visualization: Red/yellow curved path around obstacles
└─ Switches to GLOBAL_PLANNER when clearance reached
```

## Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Clear Path to Goal
```
State: GLOBAL_PLANNER
Path Type: global
Visualization: Straight line from robot to goal
Updated: Real-time as robot moves
```

### Scenario 2: Obstacle Blocking Path
```
State 1: GLOBAL_PLANNER → detects obstacle
State 2: SURVEYING → 360° scan
State 3: LOCAL_AVOIDANCE → plans A* path
Path Type: local
Visualization: Curved path around obstacle
Updated: Real-time, replans if dynamic obstacles detected
```

### Scenario 3: Transitioning Between Modes
```
Robot approaches obstacle:
  GLOBAL path → disappears
  360° survey → no path
  LOCAL path → appears (A* around obstacle)

Robot clears obstacle:
  LOCAL path → disappears
  GLOBAL path → appears (straight to goal)
```

## Benefits

1. **Visual Feedback**: Always see the robot's intended path
2. **Mode Awareness**: Instantly know which navigation mode is active
3. **Debugging**: Easier to diagnose planning issues
4. **Path Validation**: Verify planned paths make sense
5. **Real-time Updates**: Paths update as robot moves and replans

## Technical Details

### Path Message Structure
```python
Path
├─ header
│  ├─ frame_id: "map"
│  └─ stamp: current time
└─ poses[]
   └─ PoseStamped
      ├─ header (same as path header)
      └─ pose
         ├─ position
         │  ├─ x: waypoint x
         │  ├─ y: waypoint y
         │  └─ z: 0.1 (global) or 0.0 (local)
         └─ orientation
            └─ quaternion: direction along path
```

### Update Frequency
- Both path types: ~10 Hz (same as control loop)
- Global path: Recalculated every iteration (cheap - just interpolation)
- Local path: Republished from stored waypoints (cached A* result)

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal**: Path publishing is lightweight
- Global path calculation: ~0.1ms (simple interpolation)
- Local path republish: ~0.05ms (just message construction)
- Total overhead: < 1% of control loop time

## Troubleshooting

### Path Not Visible in RViz
- Check `/planned_path` topic is being published: `ros2 topic hz /planned_path`
- Verify Path display is added and topic is correct
- Check frame_id matches RViz fixed frame (should be "map")

### Path Switching Too Fast
- Normal behavior during mode transitions
- If flickering: Check obstacle detection parameters
- May indicate replanning issues

### Wrong Path Type Displayed
- Check robot state: `ros2 topic echo /planner_state`
- Global path should only show in GLOBAL_PLANNER state
- Local path should only show in LOCAL_AVOIDANCE state

### Path Not Updating
- Verify control loop is running (check logs)
- Check robot odometry is being received
- Ensure goal is set

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Multiple path publishers**: Separate topics for global and local
2. **Path smoothing visualization**: Show both raw and smoothed A* paths
3. **Cost visualization**: Color-code path by traversal cost
4. **Predicted trajectory**: Show robot's predicted motion
5. **Alternative paths**: Visualize backup path options
